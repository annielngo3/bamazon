# bamazon
Bamazon is a command line node application using MySQL and npm packages to create an online store. 

With Bamazon, users have the luxury of shopping for anything from their home and in their pjs. The customer view of the app takes orders from the users, then updates the store's inventory. This app takes in the user input and gives the customer the appropriate response. 

Managers can log onto their portal to see a set list of directory options. Managers would be able to do the following:
- View products that are for sale
- View items that have a low inventory
- To add new products to the inventory
Depending on which command the manager enters, the app will take the input and give a response. 

Technologies Used: Javascript, Node.js, MySQL and NPM
